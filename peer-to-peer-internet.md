Toronto Mesh will be running the workshop series **{{ page.title }}** each Tuesday from April 10 to May 15, 2018 at the [{{ page.location }}]({{ page.locationLink }}).

Participants will learn about community networks, wireless mesh networks, distributed applications, and train their pet Raspberry Pi to do networking things. While this course assumes no technical expertise, all sessions contain a technical hands-on component and a reflection activity to explore the role of technologies on our society. A socially-minded tinkerer who enjoys a collaborative learning experience will be the ideal participant.

* Tue Apr 24 - *Building nodes (hardware)*

* Tue May 08 - *Measuring networks*
* Tue May 15 - *Living on a decentralized network*
