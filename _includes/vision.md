Internet service is currently a black-box to most of its users. We are building a community-owned infrastructure that gives us:

- **agency** to make important decisions about their privacy
- **autonomy** to access information in an uncontrolled/free manner
- opportunity to develop **technical literacies**
- a **resilient** and redundant network
- open, lower-cost **access** to the World Wide Web
