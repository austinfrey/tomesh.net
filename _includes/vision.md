The internet is currently not open and inclusive for all people. We are building a community-owned infrastructure that gives us:

- open, lower-cost **access** to the World Wide Web
- a **resilient** and redundant network
- **agency** to make important decisions about privacy
- **autonomy** to access information in a free manner
- an opportunity to develop **technical literacies**
