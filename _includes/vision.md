We are going to build an infrastructure that gives users:

- **agency** to make important decisions about their privacy
- **autonomy** to access information in an uncontrolled/free manner
- opportunity to develop **technical literacies**
- a **resilient** and redundant network
- open, lower-cost **access** to the World Wide Web

...In order to address the fact that Internet infrastructure is a black-box to most of its users.
