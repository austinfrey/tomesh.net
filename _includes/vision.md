Internet service is currently sold as a black-box to most of us. We are building a community-owned infrastructure that gives all its users:

- **agency** to make important decisions about their privacy
- **autonomy** to access information in an uncontrolled/free manner
- opportunity to develop **technical literacies**
- a **resilient** and redundant network
- open, lower-cost **access** to the World Wide Web
