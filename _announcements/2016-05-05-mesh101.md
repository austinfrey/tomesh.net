Join us for a **mesh.101 workshop** this Thursday! We will spend 30 minutes demystifying networking and mesh concepts, cover how to set up the our Raspberry Pi-based reference node, dive into the hardware and software, and discuss why we made certain technology choices and implications to access to our information. We will then move into a one-hour unstructured time where we will play with the mesh devices and discuss specific topics that come up.

The workshop assumes no prior networking or programming knowledge, all are welcome and Robarts is an accessible space.
