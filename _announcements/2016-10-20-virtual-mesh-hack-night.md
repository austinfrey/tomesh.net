title: "Virtual Mesh Hack Night"

Some Toronto Mesh members are connected through a virtual mesh network. This is a transitionary phase where our mesh nodes are connected to one another via an Internet connection instead of a physical line or radio. We are nonetheless able to play with distributed applications as if we are connected through a physical mesh.

Every other Thursday at **8:00 pm EST**, we meet virtually on [#virtualmesh:tomesh.net](https://chat.tomesh.net/#/room/#virtualmesh:tomesh.net) and do some hands on hackery such as running services on our Raspberry Pi platform and testing distributed appications like [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/).

If you would like to join us, just hop on the Matrix channel listed above and say hi. Things generally start at 8:00 pm with people checking in and out throughout the night. Although the [cjdns mesh software](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns) run on multiple platforms, most people are [running it on a Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/tomeshnet/prototype-cjdns-pi2). No matter how you may like to join, the friendly people on the channel will be happy to help you get meshed up.
