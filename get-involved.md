To see the current status of the Toronto Mesh project, visit our publicly-viewable [Kanban board](https://wekan.tomesh.net/b/LWS8X7sGFXqDgZ7ag/tomesh-net) and [github account](https://github.com/tomeshnet).

## How do I work with you?

### Collaborate on our Kanban Board at [wekan.tomesh.net](https://wekan.tomesh.net)
Toronto Mesh uses a [Kanban (看板)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban) to keep track of ideas and progress. The software we use is the self-hosted open-source [Wekan](https://github.com/wekan/wekan). Anyone is free to create an account and participate.

You can contribute to the project in many ways. Start by [creating an account](https://wekan.tomesh.net) for our Kanban, and then ask on [ #tomesh](https://chat.tomesh.net/#/room/#tomesh:tomesh.net) or email [hello@tomesh.net](mailto:hello@tomesh.net) for an invite to our main Board.

#### Propose an Idea

- Create a new card in the **Ideas** column by adding a short title
- Include details in the description
- Add appropriate labels for easy filtering

#### Participate in the Discussion

- You can add a comment to an existing card, regardless of what column the card is in
- Visit [tomesh.net](https://tomesh.net) to find out about in-person events and our [#tomesh](https://chat.tomesh.net/#/room/#tomesh:tomesh.net) chat channel to discuss

#### Work on a Card

- Find a card you would like to take ownership and add yourself as a member to that card
- Move the card to the **In Progress** column, or **Discuss** column if that needs to happen first for the particular card
- When completed, move the card to the **Done** column (typically for a task that leads to a Pull Request in our [Github repositories](https://github.com/tomeshnet/) is usually considered done when reviewed and merged)

### Contribute to our git Repositories on [github.com/tomeshnet](https://github.com/tomeshnet/)
We use git, a version control tool, and [Github](https://github.com/tomeshnet/) repositories to work on and publicly host our technical prototypes ([Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/tomeshnet/prototype-cjdns-pi2), [ODROID](https://github.com/tomeshnet/prototype-cjdns-odroidc2)), this [website](https://github.com/tomeshnet/tomesh.net), and keep a record of [important documents](https://github.com/tomeshnet/documents) like our meeting notes.

If you notice any errors, would like to submit changes, or add content, read our [Git workflow](https://github.com/tomeshnet/documents/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and contribute to our GitHub repositories.
