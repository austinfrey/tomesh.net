title: Code of Conduct
---

Toronto Mesh voted to adopt a code of conduct in order to provide a harassment-free environment and we are working on [a draft](https://github.com/tomeshnet/documents/blob/c0c82f1cf7d76c23e926d28f6c7747c4fcd68d13/CONDUCT.md).

We will be finalizing the text in the next few weeks and would like additional feedback. You can let us know your thoughts using our [contact details]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact) or comment [directly on the draft](https://github.com/tomeshnet/documents/pull/23).
