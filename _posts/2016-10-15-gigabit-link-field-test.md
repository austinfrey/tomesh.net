Let's test out the range and bandwidth of a pair of [Ubiquiti LiteBeam ac](https://www.ubnt.com/airmax/litebeam-ac/) before winter hits. We have portable power to bring these devices around and benchmark performance over a cjdns link. Here is a [general overview](https://wekan.tomesh.net/b/LWS8X7sGFXqDgZ7ag/tomesh-net/pPnPbWjaHLXGrW9iS). Hop onto [#hardware:tomesh.net](https://chat.tomesh.net/#/room/#hardware:tomesh.net) to do some pre-planning and sort out the appropriate meeting location for our **October 15 Field Test**.
