_It’s a stormy winter night. You see a UFO in the sky and quickly learn that we may be under threat from an Evil Alien Mastermind. You try to notify the the rest of the city and the world, but you realize that this Alien has disrupted the internet, our primary mode of communication. Luckily, over the past years local communities have wired up parts of North America with a community network, which the Alien may not know about!_

_You need to get the message to all the communities before he takes them over, battling weather conditions and his evil tactics._

Join Toronto Mesh during the [Maker Festival Extravaganza](http://makerfestival.ca/extravaganza/) on **Saturday, July 9** and **Sunday, July 10** and check out our interactive game exploring how the internet works!

At the Maker Festival we hope to set up a game that conveys network infrastructure concepts in a fun and non-technical way while being inclusive to all age groups. Through the mechanics of the game, the audience will learn about alternatives to centralized internet infrastructure, how encryption technology protects against bad actors, and most importantly, the physical pathways through which information travels beyond our computer screens.

Email [hello@tomesh.net](mailto:hello@tomesh.net) to learn more or find us during the event!
