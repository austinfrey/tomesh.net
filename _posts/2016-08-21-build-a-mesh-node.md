Join us at [HackLab.TO](https://hacklab.to) for a **FREE** hands-on workshop to build a mesh node based on the Raspberry Pi platform. We will start with a very brief intro to mesh networks and the Raspberry Pi, then jump run into setting up the mesh with our [open-source tomesh software](https://github.com/tomeshnet/prototype-cjdns-pi2). The nodes made here will be the beginning of the tomesh testnet.

After the initial setting up, the workshop will be free-form with small groups prototyping what services can be run on this ad-hoc mesh, discussing ideas and testing them.

No prior experience with software, hardware, or networking is needed; meanwhile showing up with vague project ideas are strongly encouraged :) Please bring a laptop if you can, all other hardware will be provided.
