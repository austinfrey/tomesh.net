Join Toronto Mesh for a three hour intro to networks workshop on **Saturday, June 25** as part of the 2016 [Makerfestival](http://makerfestival.ca/events/introduction-to-networks-from-the-internet-to-tomesh-net/)! Through hands-on activities and play we will cover basics of:

* how networks like the internet operate  
* features and quirks specific to the internet  
* alternate forms of networks (like mesh networks) that people can use to connect with each other!  

Absolutely no experience or prior knowledge is required. All you need is enthusiasm and curiosity! This is a beginner, family-friendly workshop.

Toronto Mesh will be setting up a mesh network (tomesh.mini) at the Maker Festival, so come to this workshop if you want to find out more about what a ‘mesh’ will look like!

Email [hello@tomesh.net](mailto:hello@tomesh.net) to register for this event!
