On the last Sunday of every month we meet to talk about network readings. In between we coordinate on  [#reading-networks:tomesh.net](https://chat.tomesh.net/#/room/#reading-networks:tomesh.net). Join us at [HackLab.TO](https://hacklab.to) for our {{ page.date | date: "%B"}} reading group!

New people are always welcome. Come say hi on our chat, or email us at [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}), to find out what we will be reading for the month!
